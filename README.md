# Student-Depression-Data-Analysis-Dashboard

This Student Depression Data Analysis Dashboard aims to explore potential factors contributing to student depression by analyzing behavioral, academic, and lifestyle patterns. It provides a multi-dimensional view of how various stressors and habits correlate with students’ well-being.

🔍 What the Dashboard Analyzes:
1. Academic Pressure

Shows the distribution of students based on their self-rated academic pressure (1 to 5).

Majority report moderate to high pressure (level 3 has the highest count: 125).

2. Financial Stress

Indicates a consistently high level of financial stress, with most students rating it at level 1 (least stressful), yet other levels still show significant counts.

3. Study Satisfaction

Plots how satisfied students are with their studies.

Highest satisfaction at level 4 (116 students), suggesting study satisfaction may not directly reduce depression.

4. Study Hours

Displays how many hours students study daily.

Peaks at 10 hours (53 students), but students are fairly distributed across different study durations.

5. Dietary Habits

Breaks students into three categories: Healthy, Moderate, and Unhealthy diets.

Fairly balanced distribution, but slightly more students follow moderate dietary habits.

6. Sleep Duration

Analyzes how much students sleep.

Very even distribution across all sleep categories, but nearly half (49%) sleep either less than 7 hours, which could relate to mental health issues.

📈 How This Dashboard Helps:

Identify Key Risk Factors: Helps detect which factors (academic pressure, financial stress, sleep deprivation, etc.) are most prevalent among students who might be at risk of depression.

Guide Interventions: Institutions can use this to target counseling, financial aid, or wellness programs toward students with high academic/financial stress or poor sleep/diet habits.

Monitor Trends: Over time, changes in these trends can help evaluate the impact of mental health initiatives.

Promote Awareness: Visualizing data in this way raises awareness among faculty and administration about the real pressures students face.

📌 Summary:

This dashboard offers valuable insights into the lifestyle and academic factors influencing student mental health, enabling better policy-making, resource allocation, and support systems to improve student well-being.
